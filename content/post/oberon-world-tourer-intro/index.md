I’ve ridden bikes that were fast, bikes that were light, bikes that made you feel like you could outrun the wind.

But I’ve never ridden a bike that asked nothing of me, except to keep going.

The **Posst Oberon** isn’t a gravel bike, though you could take it where most gravel bikes wouldn’t dare. It’s not a touring bike in the old-fashioned sense either — not unless you think touring means crossing continents with quiet confidence. It’s something rarer. A bicycle built with no apologies. Designed for distance. For dust. For silence.

And I didn’t pick it from a catalogue of bikes — not really. I picked it because it felt like the kind of bike I’d want to write poetry about.

### Why Oberon?

I already have a gravel bike. A good one. The [**Scolarian Mudfest**]({{< relref "forged-for-the-ride-scolarian-mudfest" >}}) — as tough as its name suggests. So when Posst offered me a chance to review one of their bikes, I didn’t go the obvious route. I wasn’t chasing carbon or aero or watts. I wanted something with permanence. A bike that felt inevitable.

The Oberon is that bike.

It comes from the same minds who welded my Mudfest, but it’s cut from different cloth. Or more precisely, [**Columbus Zona steel**](https://www.columbustubi.com/en/tubing-set/zona/) — double butted, tig-welded in Coimbatore, then finished with **Axalta/Glasurit VOC-compliant coatings** to survive every monsoon and heatwave India can throw at it.

That matters when you're crossing Himachal in the summer and Andhra in the rain.

I ride a **54cm**, and at 5'8", it fits like a glove stitched by someone who understands what long days feel like.

### The Silence of Simplicity

There’s no derailleur. No cable stretch. No missed shifts when the trail turns ugly.

What there is: a [**Rohloff Speedhub 500/14**](https://www.rohloff.de/en/products/speedhub), mated to a [**Gates CDX Carbon Belt Drive**](https://www.gatescarbondrive.com/products/cdx) — 50T up front, 20T at the rear. What this means on the road is simple: **absolute silence**. Shifting that feels like thought. No chain grease. No clatter.

And here's something worth knowing: to receive full warranty from Rohloff when paired with a Gates Carbon Drive, a frame must pass a stiffness certification test. The Oberon is one of the few in India that does. It’s officially tested and approved — which means: silence, yes. But also confidence.

The **crank** is a 170mm S550, the **bottom bracket** a 68mm MegaExo. The **cockpit is** [**DEDA Zero1**](https://www.dedaelementi.com/zero1/). Everything feels just right — not flashy, just purposeful. It doesn’t try to impress. It tries to last.

The [**TRP HY/RD disc brakes**](https://www.trpcycling.com/product/hy-rd/), paired with 180mm and 160mm rotors, are overkill in the best way. They'll stop you even when fully loaded with camping gear and a week’s worth of indecision.

Lighting? **Dynamo-powered** — a [**SP PL-7 front hub**](https://www.shutterprecision.com/product-page/pl-7), running a DS-4 system that glows long after dusk. No batteries to worry about. Just movement.

### What Kind of Bike Is This?

If you’re the sort who asks for genres, the Oberon will frustrate you. It isn’t one thing. It’s a little too relaxed to race, a little too serious to be called “gravel,” and far too intentional to be just another touring bike.

But if you’ve ever dreamed of riding to the edge of Ladakh, your panniers humming in the silence, no sound but wind — and the thought of what’s next — then you already understand what kind of bike this is.

It’s not a bike for people who count grams.

It’s for people who count sunsets.

### So, Why This Bike?

Because it does what no other bike in India currently does.

Because **no one else is making bikes like this here** — with this mix of heritage tubing, forward-thinking drivetrain, and a geometry that doesn’t flinch at switchbacks.

And because, let’s be honest, I didn’t need another bike.

But I needed this one.

The **Oberon**, with its full touring setup — racks, fenders, dynamo lighting, kickstand, and more — comes in at ₹3.10 lakhs.  
**Posst ships across India.**

> Where silence matters. And gears don’t miss a beat.*
